## Features

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

Includes a click-able 'logo' and links to all other pages on the website: gallery, about & contact.
Navigation bar remains the same on every page on the website to navigate easily back and forth between pages without the need of the browser's own buttons.
'Home' link was provided but flagged up in accessability testing as redundant link due to the clickable logo, so it was removed from nav bar.
